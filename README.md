UDPLauncher_GUI
===============
UDPLauncher is a small application with a GUI that servers as an UDP Listener (Windows Only). It can run in the background an be minimized to the tray. The listener is then able to start an application if it receives a UDP package on the specified port.

It can also be configured to launch a specified XBMC Event which will be fired against a running XBMC instance upon receiving a package.
